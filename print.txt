=Athlete & Parent Code of Conduct
Participation on the ice at the Toronto Speed Skating Club (“TSSC”) is a privilege, not a right, which should elicit great pride in skaters and their families. Our standards of behavior are exceedingly high and a willingness to live up to them is a condition of being a member of TSSC.

Consistent with these standards, and as a continued condition of participation, skaters and parents are required to sign this statement of personal commitment. The athlete’s signature, along with that of his/her parent/guardian, indicates that both recognize and understand the responsibility to adhere to the basic concepts of good citizenship, fair play, and those positive examples with which every TSSC participant should be identified.

The goal of our Club is to support athletes in pursuit of excellence and achieving their potential in the sport of speed skating. To do this, we need to appreciate that there is a need to maintain a strong behavioral and discipline code to support each and every athlete’s efforts.

While participating in any Club activity including practices, meets, social events, team travel, overnight stays in hotels/motels, dining in restaurants and when in or on public/private property, including change rooms and parking lots, etc., athletes are expected to demonstrate responsible manner, as befits TSSC.

Unacceptable behavior as listed below will not be tolerated at any time: use of foul language, bullying, damage to facilities, fighting, unsportsmanlike conduct, use of drugs, tobacco or alcohol, sexual harassment act; committing any which would be considered an illegal offence.

Should any unacceptable incident occur, actions may include:
- verbal/written warning
- being sent home from an event at the member’s expense,
- being held financially responsible for intentional damage to property
￼
Skaters and his/her parents/guardians are encouraged to promote sportsmanship at all practices and meets through your actions by demonstrating positive support for all skaters, coaches, officials and spectators regardless of race, creed, religion, gender or ability.

We recognize the importance of volunteer coaches and their importance to the development of the individual skater and TSSC will work to provide a positive experience for all.

All coaches should be treated with dignity and respect in language, attitude, behavior and mannerisms.

Skaters will follow the program and instructions as set out by the coaches.

Failure to do so may result in immediate dismissal from the program. Disrespect to coaches or undermining their authority will not be tolerated.

Programming offered by TSSC is not a custodial setting therefore, children (under 18) may not be left unattended at the arena unless in the care of a guardian.
